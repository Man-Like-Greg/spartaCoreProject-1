#TEST YOUR MEMORY GAME

## How To Play

This project is based on a basic browser game using Javascript, CSS and HTML. Test your memory game is a one player game where the user has to clicks start to begin the game and the aim is to pair two boxes with in 60 seconds. If a match is not made then the images will fadeout but if a match is made then the pair will stay displayed. When ever the user clicks on a box with a image of Minions then the game will end but if the game is completed within the 60 seconds then a win message will be displayed.
